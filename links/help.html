    <h1>Help Area</h1>
    <p>
      This is the help page for the MUN Program. If issues continue or your
      questions remain after reading this, feel free to email me at
      <b>spence [at] duck.com</b>.

    <h2>Timer</h2>
    <p>
      When the committee sets a speech and comment time, enter them into the
      respective speech and comment text boxes. To load either timer into the
      main top timer, click the speech button or comment button, which will load
      the time. Proceed to click "Start" to start the time or "Pause" to pause
      it. The caucus timer is controlled from the two buttons underneath it.
      Simply enter a time and click "Start" to start or "Pause" to pause. The
      caucus timer is used for both unmoderated and moderated caucuses; in
      addition, during a moderated caucus, the caucus timer and main timer can
      be run at the same time. The timer boxes will automatically format to
      mm:ss, so type each minute and second (for example a 1:15 second speech
      time would be entered as 01 *wait* 15). You can also type a single minute
      with a colon (1:15). When switching from speeches to comments or vice
      versa, click "Pause" to give the delegate time to stand and begin. When
      deleting the times, click the Dackspace or Delete key once to clear the
      timer box.

    <h2>Speakers' List</h2>
    <p>
      Make sure that each country name in the speakers' list matches the listed
      name in the dropdown menu. It is recommended to select the country from
      the menu, press Enter, then press Tab to continue entering in the country
      names. Once all the speakers have been entered, click the "Next Speaker"
      button at the bottom of the speakers' list. The current speaker will be
      highlighted in yellow. If there are two delegates of the same country,
      simply type their country name and a number separated by a space (for
      example: "France 1"). If more country boxes are required, scroll to the
      bottom of the speakers' list and click the "More Speakers" button. To
      reset the speakers' list, click the Reset List button at the bottom of the
      list. If multiple speakers' lists are required for moderated caucus for
      example, type "Speakers' List 2" in the speakers' list box then add the
      speakers underneath and click "Next Speaker".
